//Exercise 1.2. Before you do anything else, find out how to compile and run a Java program in your environment. 
//Some environments provide sample programs similar to the example in Section 1.5.
//1. Type in the “Hello, world” program, then compile and run it.
//2. Add a print statement that prints a second message after the “Hello, world!”. Something witty like, “How are you?” Compile and run the program again.
//3. Add a comment to the program (anywhere), recompile, and run it again. The new comment should not a↵ect the result.

public class Exercise1_2 {

	public static void main(String[] args) {
				System.out.println("Hello World");//1st Line
				System.out.println("Well Hello?");//2nd Line
				System.out.println("I am good!");//3rd Line
				System.out.println("Am I talking to the computer or myself?");//4th
				System.out.println("Depends on your perspective.");//5th
				}
